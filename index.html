                                <h3>Introduction to Programming</h3>
                                <p>Introduction to Programming courses aim to teach the fundamentals of programming,
                                    covering basic programming concepts, commonly used programming languages,
                                    programming tools and environments, and essential programming skills. Learning
                                    introductory programming can help you understand the basic principles of programming
                                    and lay the foundation for learning more advanced programming knowledge.</p>
                                <h3>Data Structures</h3>
                                <p>Data structures are ways of storing and organizing data in computer science, designed
                                    for efficient access and modification of data. Common data structures include
                                    arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. Learning data structures
                                    can help you understand how to effectively organize and manage data, and lay the
                                    foundation for learning algorithms and programming.</p>
                                <h3>Algorithms</h3>
                                <p>Algorithms are a series of steps to solve a problem, designed to effectively solve
                                    problems. Algorithms play an important role in computer science and are widely used
                                    in various fields, such as searching, sorting, graphics processing, and machine
                                    learning. Learning algorithms can help you understand how to design and analyze
                                    algorithms and improve your programming skills.</p>
